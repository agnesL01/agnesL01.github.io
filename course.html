											Modern vertical farming systems require cost-effective, accurate sensing of environmental factors such as airflow, temperature, & humidity. In this paper, we fabricate, analyze, & simulate an integrated MEMS combined airflow, temperature, & humidity sensor for applications in vertical farming. We employ cantilever structures for the airflow and humidity sensors and thin-film RTD for the temperature sensor. Through COMSOL simulation, we achieve an airflow sensor sensitivity of .2 Î¼m / (m/s) and show that theoretical analysis comes within an order of magnitude of the simulated result. We further demonstrate reasonable isolation from temperature and humidity effects. Future work improving our sensor may enable individual plant-level monitoring for large scale vertical farming systems.

											In this final project, we initially constructed two 8-bit counters using two distinct types of D flip-flop implementations, namely static and dynamic. Subsequently, we compared the counters based on three factors: the minimum period required for the counter to function correctly with varying Vdd values, the overall area occupied by the counter, and the peak power consumption. Based on our analysis, we deduce that the dynamic flip flop proves to be a superior choice. Following that, we proceeded with the construction of our comprehensive N-bit counter with dynamic D flip-flop, which possesses the capability to select the desired bit count, ranging from 4 to 8.

											Micro-sized cameras have great potential in identifying defects in the human body and enabling sensing for super-small robots. The performance, and resolution of micro-sized cameras is a challenge encountered in several engineering and medical applications. For instance, micro-sized camera images are fuzzy, and have limited fields of view. The objective of this project is to design a two-wires interface data camera. We aimed to optimize the power consumption of the design and reduce the complexity of the system by using a 2-wire interface. The designs consisted of 4 major blocks: rectifier, clock, array of 3-transistor pixels, and the connector interface between the pixels and the lines.
