									<h3>Inspiration</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									The battery voltage in electric vehicles is around 400 volts, and car companies are planning to raise this to 800 volts to enable <strong>faster charging</strong> and <strong>more efficient driving</strong>. However, many loads in electric vehicles require low voltages, including numerous microcontrollers. To allow the microcontrollers, which run off about <strong>1 volt</strong>, to be powered by an <strong>800-volt battery</strong>, an efficient and compact power converter is needed to convert the voltage from 800 volts to 1 volt. The power converter also needs to have <strong>isolation</strong> between its input and output to prevent the chance of an electric shock at the low voltage side. Conventional isolated power converters that provide large voltage conversion are not very efficient. Unlike conventional switching power converters, which use transformers for isolation and large voltage conversion, this research project focuses on a <strong>light-based </strong>approach that first transforms electricity at 800 volts to light and then transforms the light to electricity at 1 volt. One way to achieve this is by using a large number of series connected laser diode transmitters coupled optically to a large number of paralleled laser diode receivers. This method provides electrical isolation automatically.

									<h3>Introduction</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									The model of this power converter can be divided into 3 parts: <strong> the input part </strong> that takes in eletrical energy and generates out light energy, <strong> the transition part </strong> that the light energy is transferred from the input side to the output side, and <strong> the output part </strong> that changes the light energy back into the electrical energy. When building the model, we used <strong>20 cells</strong> in total and developed three different designs:
								</p>
								<ul>
								<li><strong>Input side:</strong> 20 cells in parallel</li>
								<li><strong>Output side:</strong>
									<ol>
									<li> 20 cells in series </li>
									<li> 2 cells in parallel as a group; 10 groups in series </li>
									<li> 10 cells in parallel as a group; 2 groups in series </li>
								</ol>
								</ul>
								<p>
									<strong>LTSpice</strong> is used for simulating all these three models. We fixed the input power and varied the output load to find the maximum output power, which was then used to measure the efficiency while assuming the efficiency of eletricity &#8594 light &#8594 eletricity transferation is <strong> 0.5</strong>.

								<p>
									The power loss is independent of the developed models. The efficiency of this light-based converter is limited to about <strong> 34% </strong>using commercially available components.

									<h3>Inspiration</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									The intermediate dc distribution voltage in datacenters is increasing from 12 volts to 48 volts to cater to larger loads. However, microprocessors in datacenters require low voltages of around 1 volt. To power microprocessors from 48 volts, a compact and efficient power converter is needed to convert the voltage from <strong>48 volts to 1 volt</strong>. Conventional power converters utilize inductors and capacitors as intermediate energy storage elements to provide large voltage conversion ratios. These converters are large and inefficient due to low energy density and low quality factor of inductors. Inductors can potentially be replaced by <strong>piezoelectric-resonators</strong>, which have much higher energy density and quality factor. Unlike inductors, which store energy in magnetic fields, piezoelectric-resonators store energy in mechanical compliance and inertia. Therefore, they are not a one-to-one replacement of an inductor and new power converter topologies are needed to leverage their superior characteristics. The objective of this research is to develop new power converter topologies that leverage piezoelectric-resonators to enable compact and efficient 48-volt-to-1-volt power converters.

									<h3>Tools Used</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									While conducting this research, I use <strong>PLECS</strong>ï¼Œ <strong>LTspice</strong>, and <strong>SIMetrix/SIMPLIS</strong> to simulate the behaviors of piezoelectric-resonators in various developed power converter topologies. <strong> MATLAB </strong> is used for calculating parameters used for open-loop control system, and <strong>Altium Designer</strong> is used for PCB design.

									<h3>Results</h3>

								<p>
									The detailed results are shown in a paper accepted by <strong>IEEE COMPEL 2023</strong>. A link to the papaer will be added later after the paper is published.
